/* 
 TLDR: Call .value on Lazy<T>, you will get the value you are looking for. (most likely a double)
 
 What is Lazy<T>, and why do we need it?
 
 Lazy<T> allows us to create a value, but defer its calculation until the point that it is used.
 In the event that the value is unused, then the calculation will be avoided entirely.

 eg. The BezierAction update handler supplys two arguments, position and rotation: () -> (position: Double, rotation: Lazy<Double>)
 
 Positon is quick to calculate, and will be used by the supplied closure in pretty much all cases.
 Rotation is a bit more intensive to calculate, and the closure might not even use it.
 Wrapping the calculation in Lazy<Double>, rotation will not be caluclated if rotation.value is never called.
 
 The result of the value is cached, so calling calling .value multiple times will only perform the calculation once
 */


/**
 Wrapper for long running calulations. Calculation will not be performed until .value is called.
